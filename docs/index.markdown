I am an undergraduate and coterminal master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. I am heavily involved in artificial intelligence research and I plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or Robotics.
<!-- I am specifically interested in reinforcement learning.  -->
My interests lie primarily within reinforcement learning (RL) research.
<!-- Currently, my primary research interests lie in answering the following questions:
 -->
I am especially fascinated with answering the following questions:
  - How can we make RL agents that can generalize quickly and efficiently to new tasks?
  - How can we make RL algorithms that leverage prior knowledge about a task during training instead of training from *tabula rasa?*

Currently, I am conducting research in the Stanford [IRIS](https://irislab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} Lab under Professor [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/){:target="_blank"}, where I am developing an offline RL algorithm for heterogeneous datasets that don't have reward labels. I previously conducted research in the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory ([SISL](https://sisl.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}) under Professor [Mykel Kochenderfer](https://mykel.kochenderfer.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I conducted research on using RL for autonomous vehicle safety and control. I also worked as a research intern on a collaborative project between SISL and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ([APL](https://www.jhuapl.edu/){:target="_blank"})  on developing RL based methods to defend industrial control systems against cyber attacks.

## Volunteer Work

#### East Palo Alto Stanford Academy ([EPASA](https://haas.stanford.edu/student-programs/education-partnerships/east-palo-alto-stanford-academy-epasa){:target="_blank"})
*October 2018 – March 2020*

*Volunteer Tutor*



[EPASA](https://haas.stanford.edu/student-programs/education-partnerships/east-palo-alto-stanford-academy-epasa){:target="_blank"} is a program run through Stanford University in which undergraduate students tutor middle school students who attend school in East Palo Alto.
As a volunteer tutor at EPASA, I tutored seventh and eighth grade students in math and English.

#### Stanford 1st Ward Volunteer Tutoring Program
*September 2017 – June 2019*

*Volunteer Tutor*

The Stanford 1st Ward Volunteer Tutoring Program is a program run through a local religious organization that provides free tutoring to K-12 students from around the South San Francisco Bay Area.
As a volunteer tutor, I tutored students in math, reading, and English.
